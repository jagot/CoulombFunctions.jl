A small Julia package for the evaluation of [spherical Bessel
functions](https://dlmf.nist.gov/10#PT4) using the approach described
in

- Barnett, A. R. (1996). The Calculation of Spherical Bessel and
  Coulomb Functions. In (Eds.), Computational Atomic Physics
  (pp. 181â€“202). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

A fix in the rescaling step occurring in the vicinity of roots of the
`sinc` function was implemented similarly to the suggestion here:
